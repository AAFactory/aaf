## 1. Privacy policy   
The Awesome Application Factory ("AAF") is not a for-profit corporation or individual business.   
It aims to mash up off-source libraries and develop and distribute applications so that users can use free and convenient applications without advertising.   
As a result, AAF's applications do not run separate servers to store your data and personal information, nor do they handle your personal information unnecessarily.   
If you want backup and recovery for your application, you can use Google's OAuth authentication with your consent to save your application data in your personal Google Drive and use it for future backup requests.   
Your backup data will not be made public unless you separately set up sharing in Google Drive.
